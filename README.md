# twtter-thread-image-ripper

Rips and saves images posted in a twitter thread. Ignores profile pictures and tries to focus on the main pictures that you most likely want to save anyways.

# Usage

Since the code is a shitfest, here are a couple examples to get it working.

```
python tt.py <profile/media_url> :orig -p
python tt.py <thread_url> :small
python tt.py -h
```

If it seemingly does nothing run it again. Stay away from giving it a folder to write to. Things might and will get messy.
